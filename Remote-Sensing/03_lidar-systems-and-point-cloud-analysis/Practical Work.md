# Exercises (remote sensing undergradute) – LiDAR Systems and Point Cloud Analysis
> Here are 10 practical exercises to apply the concepts from the chapter "LiDAR Systems and Point Cloud Analysis" and prepare for the assessment. They are specifically designed for remote sensing undergradute.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 1: Choosing the Right LiDAR Platform
> You are a project manager at a remote sensing consultancy. Three clients have approached you with the following mapping needs:
> 1.  **Urban Planning:** Creating a highly-detailed 3D model of a 2 km stretch of a city street, including building facades, street furniture, and road markings for an autonomous vehicle simulation.
> 2.  **Forestry Inventory:** Assessing the forest canopy structure and ground topography over a 500 km² national park to estimate biomass.
> 3.  **Coastal Monitoring:** Precisely measuring cliff face erosion and rockfall at a specific, unstable 100m-long cliff section.
>
> Your task is to match each project with the most suitable LiDAR platform (`==Airborne LiDAR System (ALS)==`, `==Terrestrial LiDAR System (TLS)==`, or `==Mobile LiDAR System (MLS)==`) and briefly justify your choice for each, considering factors like scale, required detail, and perspective.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 2: Deconstructing the LAS File
> The `==.LAS==` file format is the industry standard for LiDAR point cloud data. Imagine you have received a `project_data.las` file.
>
> 1.  Describe the three main sections of a standard LAS file.
> 2.  List at least **five** essential per-point attributes that you would expect to find (e.g., X, Y, Z coordinates).
> 3.  Explain the difference between the `==.LAS==` and `==.LAZ==` formats and state when you would prefer to use the `.LAZ` format.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Think about the metadata, the actual point data, and any user-defined information. For the attributes, consider what is needed for both spatial positioning and classification.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 3: The Journey of a LiDAR Pulse
> An airborne LiDAR system is surveying a mixed woodland area containing both tall coniferous trees and lower, dense shrubs. A single laser pulse is emitted from the aircraft and travels towards the ground.
>
> Describe the likely sequence of `==returns==` this single pulse would generate. For each return (e.g., first, second, intermediate, last), identify the surface it most likely interacted with. How would this differ from a pulse hitting an open, paved area like a road?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 4: Designing a Point Cloud Classification Scheme
> You have been provided with a raw, unclassified LiDAR point cloud of a coastal area that includes a sandy beach, low dunes with vegetation, a small residential area (buildings and roads), and the water surface of the sea.
>
> Outline a step-by-step workflow to classify this point cloud. Your workflow should result in the following classes:
> - `Ground` (beach, dunes)
> - `Low Vegetation`
> - `Buildings`
> - `Water`
> - `Noise`
>
> Mention the specific point attributes or geometric features you would use at each major step (e.g., using `==intensity==` values, `==return number==`, or height from the ground).

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 5: From Point Cloud to Surface Models
> A core application of LiDAR is the generation of raster surface models. Using a classified point cloud (where points are already labelled as 'ground', 'vegetation', or 'building'), explain how you would create the following three products:
>
> 1.  `==Digital Surface Model (DSM)==`
> 2.  `==Digital Terrain Model (DTM)==`
> 3.  `==Canopy Height Model (CHM)==` (also known as a normalized DSM or nDSM)
>
> Be specific about which point classes and/or return types are used for each model and describe the final calculation needed for the CHM.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The CHM is a derived product. Think about what information you need to subtract to isolate the height of above-ground features.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 6: Calculating Point Density
> A survey is planned using an Airborne LiDAR System with the following parameters:
> - Flight Altitude: 1200 m
> - Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF): 200 kHz (200,000 pulses/sec)
> - Scan Frequency: 50 Hz
> - Scan Angle (half-angle): 20 degrees
> - Flight Speed: 70 m/s
>
> Without calculating the swath width, determine the **along-track point spacing** and the **cross-track point spacing** at nadir. Based on these, estimate the `==nominal pulse density==` (NPD) in points per square meter (points/m²). Show your basic calculations.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 7: Identifying Potential Error Sources
> After a major flood event, a river basin was surveyed with an airborne LiDAR system to assess topographic changes. Upon initial review of the data, you notice two anomalies:
> 1.  In one corner of the survey area, the point cloud appears smeared and duplicated, with features like roads appearing twice, slightly offset.
> 2.  Large areas of the point cloud over the still-water sections of the river have very few or no points.
>
> For each anomaly, propose a likely cause related to the `==LiDAR system or acquisition conditions==`. Explain why this cause would lead to the observed effect.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 8: Full-Waveform vs. Discrete Return
> A research team is studying the vertical structure of a complex, multi-layered tropical rainforest. They have the budget for either a high-end discrete return system or a `==full-waveform==` system.
>
> Argue in favour of using the **full-waveform system** for this specific application. Explain what additional information the full-waveform data provides compared to `==discrete return==` data and how this information could be crucial for accurately characterizing the forest's sub-canopy and understory vegetation.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 9: Quantifying Landslide Volume
> A landslide has occurred on a steep, vegetated hillside. You have access to two LiDAR datasets: one from before the landslide and one from immediately after. Both datasets have been classified.
>
> Outline a robust method to calculate the net volume of material displaced by the landslide. Your method should describe:
> 1.  The necessary pre-processing steps for both point clouds.
> 2.  Which `==surface models==` you would need to generate from each dataset.
> 3.  The final raster calculation (e.g., map algebra operation) you would perform to create a "Difference of DEMs" (DoD) map and calculate the `==total volume==` lost from the source area.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 10: Individual Tree Crown Delineation
> As a forestry analyst, your goal is to identify and delineate individual tree crowns from a high-resolution Airborne LiDAR dataset of a plantation forest.
>
> Describe a common workflow to achieve this, starting from a Canopy Height Model (CHM). Name the key steps and techniques involved, such as:
> - Smoothing the CHM.
> - Identifying local maxima.
> - Using a `==watershed segmentation==` or `==region growing==` algorithm.
>
> Explain the role of the `==local maxima==` in this process and what the final output would be.
