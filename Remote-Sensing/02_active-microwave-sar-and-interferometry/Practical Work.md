# Exercises (remote sensing undergradute) – Active Microwave (SAR) and Interferometry
> Here are 10 practical exercises to apply the concepts from the chapter "Active Microwave (SAR) and Interferometry" and prepare for the assessment. They are specifically designed for remote sensing undergradute.

---

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 1: Decoding SAR Backscatter
> You are given a Sentinel-1 SAR image in ==VV polarization== showing a coastal region that includes:
> 1.  An urban area
> 2.  A forested area
> 3.  The open sea on a calm day
>
> Describe the expected ==backscatter== intensity (bright, grey, or dark) for each of these three areas. Justify your answer by explaining the dominant ==scattering mechanism== for each surface type (e.g., surface scattering, volume scattering, double-bounce scattering).
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Think about surface roughness and the geometry of objects relative to the incoming radar wave. How does a building's structure differ from a tree's canopy or a calm water surface in how it reflects microwave energy?

---

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 2: Identifying Geometric Distortions
> An airborne SAR system acquires data over a steep mountain. The resulting image exhibits significant geometric distortions.
>
> - **Identify and define** the three primary geometric distortions caused by topography in a SAR image: ==layover==, ==foreshortening==, and ==shadow==.
> - **Draw a simple diagram** for each distortion, showing the sensor, the terrain profile, and the path of the radar pulses to illustrate how each effect is formed.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Relate the distortions to the side-looking nature of SAR and the timing of the return signal. Which side of the mountain (facing the sensor or away from it) is associated with each effect?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 3: The Challenge of Speckle Noise
> You have just processed a raw SAR image, and it is dominated by a "salt-and-pepper" noise pattern known as ==speckle==. Your goal is to reduce this noise to improve interpretability.
>
> Compare the application of two common speckle filters:
> - **Boxcar filter** (a mean filter)
> - **Enhanced Lee filter** (an adaptive filter)
>
> Explain the fundamental difference in their approach and discuss the trade-off between ==speckle reduction== and the ==preservation of spatial detail== (e.g., sharp edges, point targets) for each filter.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Consider how an adaptive filter uses local statistics (like variance) to decide how much to smooth a pixel, versus a filter that applies the same operation everywhere.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 4: Building a DEM with InSAR
> You need to generate a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for a remote, cloud-covered island using two SAR images from an ERS-1/2 tandem mission. This process is called ==SAR interferometry (InSAR)==.
>
> Outline the key processing steps required to get from two ==Single Look Complex (SLC)== images to a geocoded DEM. Your outline should include and briefly define the following terms: `co-registration`, `interferogram formation`, `phase unwrapping`, and `phase-to-height conversion`.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The core information for elevation is contained in the ==phase difference== between the two images. Think about the sequence of operations needed to isolate this phase information and convert it into a meaningful height value.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 5: Mapping an Earthquake's Footprint
> After a major earthquake in a desert region, you are tasked with mapping the ground deformation. You have access to pre- and post-event Sentinel-1 SAR images. You use ==Differential InSAR (DInSAR)== to create a differential interferogram.
>
> The resulting image shows a series of repeating coloured fringe patterns.
> - What does one full ==fringe cycle== (e.g., from purple to purple) represent in terms of ground displacement?
> - If you count 5 fringes moving from an area of no change towards the epicentre, what is the approximate line-of-sight displacement in that location? (Assume Sentinel-1's C-band wavelength of 5.6 cm).
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > One fringe cycle corresponds to a phase change of 2π, which relates directly to the radar's wavelength. The displacement is measured along the sensor's line-of-sight, not vertically.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 6: Assessing Flood Damage with Coherence
> A river has flooded a large agricultural plain. You want to map the extent of the inundation using an InSAR pair acquired during the flood. Instead of the interferogram, you decide to analyze the ==coherence map==.
>
> Explain why areas that were dry land before but are now covered by water will exhibit very ==low coherence==. Why is the coherence map a more reliable tool for this specific application than a simple backscatter analysis?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Coherence measures the stability of the scatterers between two acquisitions. How does the scattering behaviour of a water surface change over time compared to a stable field or a road?

---

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 7: Oil Spill and Ship Detection
> You are analyzing a RADARSAT-2 image of a busy shipping lane to monitor for illegal oil dumping. In the image, you observe a large, dark, amoeba-shaped patch and several very bright, distinct points.
>
> - Explain the physical principle that makes an ==oil spill== appear dark on a SAR image.
> - Explain why ==ships== typically appear as extremely bright point targets.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > For the oil spill, think about how oil affects the sea surface roughness and, consequently, the amount of radar signal scattered back to the sensor. For ships, consider the 'corner reflector' effect created by the ship's structure.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 8: Monitoring Deforestation with Multi-Temporal SAR
> A conservation agency wants to monitor deforestation in the Amazon rainforest using a time-series of Sentinel-1 data.
>
> Describe how a ==multi-temporal== dataset (a stack of images over time) can be used to detect the clearing of forest. Explain the expected change in ==backscatter intensity== (e.g., from HH or HV polarization) when a dense forest area is cleared, leaving bare soil.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Consider the difference in scattering mechanism between a forest canopy (dominated by volume scattering) and bare ground (dominated by surface scattering). How does this change the amount of energy returned to the sensor?

---

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 9: Characterizing Urban Areas with PolSAR
> You have access to a fully ==polarimetric SAR (PolSAR)== dataset (HH, HV, VH, VV) over a city. You apply a Cloude-Pottier decomposition, which characterizes the dominant scattering mechanism per pixel.
>
> Match the following scattering types to the most likely urban feature:
> - **Scattering Types:** Surface Scattering, Volume Scattering, Double-Bounce Scattering.
> - **Urban Features:** A park with trees, building walls oriented towards the sensor, a large asphalt parking lot.
>
> Justify your choices.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Double-bounce is a strong reflection between a smooth horizontal surface (ground) and a vertical surface (wall). Volume scattering occurs within a complex medium like a tree canopy. Surface scattering occurs off a single, relatively smooth surface.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 10: Tracking Slow Subsidence with PS-InSAR
> An urban area built on reclaimed land is experiencing slow, continuous ground subsidence. Standard DInSAR fails due to temporal decorrelation over the long time periods needed to measure the slow movement.
>
> Explain the concept of ==Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS-InSAR)==. What is a "persistent scatterer" in an urban context, and why does focusing on these specific points allow us to measure millimetre-scale deformation over many years?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > What kinds of man-made objects are likely to provide a stable, strong radar reflection over time, regardless of changes in surrounding vegetation or ground conditions? Think about building corners, lamp posts, or railway tracks.
