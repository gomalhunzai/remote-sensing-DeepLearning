# Exercises (remote sensing undergradute) – Hyperspectral Imaging and Spectroscopy
> Here are 10 practical exercises to apply the concepts from the chapter "Hyperspectral Imaging and Spectroscopy" and prepare for the assessment. They are specifically designed for remote sensing undergradute.

---

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 1: Interpreting Spectral Signatures
> Below are three reflectance spectra (A, B, C) obtained from a hyperspectral sensor. One is from a sample of the mineral **Kaolinite**, one is from **healthy green vegetation**, and one is from **clear, deep water**.
>
> 1.  Match each spectrum (A, B, C) to the correct surface material.
> 2.  For each spectrum, identify and explain the key spectral features that justify your choice. Pay attention to features like the ==red edge==, ==water absorption bands==, and characteristic ==absorption features== in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Think about the physical and chemical properties of each material. Vegetation has pigments, minerals have specific chemical bonds, and water absorbs energy strongly in the infrared. Look for diagnostic absorption features around 2.2 µm for clay minerals.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 2: The Hyperspectral Advantage
> Imagine you have a hyperspectral signature of the mineral **Goethite**, which has a characteristic sharp absorption feature at 0.92 µm. Now, consider how this signature would be represented by the **Landsat 9 OLI** sensor.
>
> - The relevant Landsat 9 bands are:
>     - Coastal/Aerosol (0.43 - 0.45 µm)
>     - Blue (0.45 - 0.51 µm)
>     - Green (0.53 - 0.59 µm)
>     - Red (0.64 - 0.67 µm)
>     - NIR (0.85 - 0.88 µm)
>
> Explain why the ==multispectral== Landsat sensor might fail to unambiguously identify Goethite, whereas a ==hyperspectral== sensor could.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Compare the spectral location of Goethite's key feature with the bandwidth of the Landsat 9 NIR band. Is the feature fully captured within a single band, or is its signature averaged out?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 3: Taming the Data Cube
> The high dimensionality of hyperspectral data often leads to the ==Hughes Phenomenon==, also known as the "curse of dimensionality," when performing image classification.
>
> 1.  In your own words, explain what the Hughes Phenomenon is.
> 2.  Describe the main goal of using a ==Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF)== transform on a hyperspectral data cube before classification.
> 3.  How would you decide how many MNF components to retain for further analysis?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > MNF is a two-step cascaded PCA transformation. Consider what each step does in terms of noise estimation and data decorrelation. The "best" components should contain coherent spatial information, not noise.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 4: Finding the Purest Pixels
> You are tasked with mapping different crop types in an agricultural area using hyperspectral data. To do this, you first need to identify the purest representative pixels, or ==endmembers==, for each crop type (e.g., corn, soy, wheat).
>
> Explain the conceptual workflow of the ==Pixel Purity Index (PPI)== algorithm for identifying endmembers. You do not need to provide mathematical formulas, but describe the steps involved and the logic behind the process.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The process involves projecting n-dimensional data points (pixels) onto random unit vectors. What does it mean for a pixel to be repeatedly projected onto the extremes of these vectors?

---

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 5: Unmixing a Pixel
> A pixel from a hyperspectral image taken over a coastline has a mixed spectrum. You have determined that the only two components present in this pixel are **dry sand** and **seawater**.
>
> Using the concept of ==Linear Spectral Unmixing==, explain how you would determine the proportion (or ==abundance==) of sand and water within that single pixel. What input data would you need to perform this analysis?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The model assumes the pixel's spectrum is a linear combination of the endmember spectra. What are the knowns and unknowns in this spectral "equation"?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 6: Advanced Vegetation Monitoring
> A key advantage of hyperspectral remote sensing is the ability to calculate narrow-band vegetation indices that are sensitive to specific biophysical parameters.
>
> 1.  Explain why the ==Red-Edge Position (REP)== is a sensitive indicator of vegetation stress.
> 2.  How does the information derived from the REP differ from a traditional ==NDVI== calculated from broad multispectral bands? Why is a hyperspectral sensor necessary to calculate REP accurately?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The "red edge" is not a fixed wavelength but a feature whose position shifts. Think about what physiological changes in a plant cause this shift.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 7: A Geologist's Toolkit
> You are part of a mineral exploration team using ==AVIRIS== hyperspectral data to search for gold deposits in an arid environment. The gold itself is not visible, but you can map key ==alteration minerals== associated with it.
>
> Your primary targets are **Alunite** and **Kaolinite**. In which region of the electromagnetic spectrum would you focus your analysis, and what specific ==absorption features== would you use to differentiate between these two minerals?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Both are clay minerals with diagnostic features in the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) region, but their double-absorption features appear at slightly different wavelengths due to differences in their chemical composition (Al-OH bonds).

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 8: The Challenge of the Atmosphere
> ==Atmospheric correction== is the process of converting top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance to at-surface reflectance. This step is exceptionally critical for hyperspectral data analysis.
>
> Explain why accurately correcting for atmospheric effects, particularly ==water vapor absorption==, is more important for hyperspectral sensors than for traditional multispectral sensors like Landsat or Sentinel-2.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Consider the narrowness of hyperspectral bands. What happens if a band falls directly within a major atmospheric absorption feature (e.g., around 1.4 µm or 1.9 µm)? How would this affect the resulting surface reflectance spectrum?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 9: Choosing the Right Classifier
> You are comparing two supervised classification algorithms to map tree species in a forest using a hyperspectral image: **Maximum Likelihood** and the **Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM)**.
>
> Explain the fundamental difference in how these two algorithms measure similarity between an unknown pixel and the training spectra. In a scenario with varying illumination conditions (e.g., sunny and shaded parts of the forest), which algorithm would likely perform better, and why?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > One classifier uses statistical distance in n-dimensional space, while the other treats spectra as vectors and calculates the angle between them. How does brightness (illumination) affect the length of a vector versus its direction?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 10: Mapping Harmful Algal Blooms
> A local environmental agency wants you to design a hyperspectral remote sensing project to monitor a harmful algal bloom (HAB) in a coastal estuary. The specific alga contains the pigment ==phycocyanin==.
>
> Outline the key steps of your proposed image processing chain, from the raw hyperspectral data cube to the final deliverable. The final product should be a map showing the spatial distribution and concentration of the algal bloom. Mention at least **four** key processing steps.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Your processing chain should include pre-processing, identifying the target's unique spectral feature, and then a method to quantify it. Phycocyanin has a characteristic absorption feature around 0.62 µm.
