> [!question]
> ### Exercise 1: Visualizing Agricultural Phenology
> Your task is to create a time-series plot of vegetation dynamics for an agricultural region.
> 1.  Select a study area known for its distinct cropping calendar (e.g., Central Valley, California, USA).
> 2.  Acquire a cloud-free ==Landsat 8/9 time-series== for two full years.
> 3.  For each image, calculate the ==Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)==.
> 4.  Generate a plot showing the mean NDVI value of your study area against the acquisition date.
> 5.  In your notes, describe the observed ==phenological cycle==. When do you estimate the start and end of the growing seasons?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > You can use the Google Earth Engine platform to easily access and process the Landsat archive and generate the time-series chart.

> ### Exercise 2: Quantifying Wildfire Impact with CVA
> You will assess the impact of a major wildfire event using ==Change Vector Analysis (CVA)==.
> 1.  Choose a recent, large-scale wildfire event (e.g., the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires).
> 2.  Obtain two Sentinel-2 images: one pre-fire and one post-fire, ensuring they are from a similar season to minimize phenological differences.
> 3.  Use two spectral bands (e.g., Near-Infrared and Short-Wave Infrared) to perform the CVA.
> 4.  Produce a map of the ==change magnitude==, highlighting the areas with the most significant change.
> 5.  Interpret the map: How does the change magnitude correspond to the known burn severity?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The change magnitude in CVA is calculated as the Euclidean distance between the two pixel vectors in the multi-dimensional spectral space. High magnitude indicates significant change.

> ### Exercise 3: Tracking Urban Expansion
> Monitor the urban growth of a rapidly developing city over a 20-year period.
> 1.  Select a city known for rapid expansion (e.g., Las Vegas, USA, or Dubai, UAE).
> 2.  Acquire two Landsat images: one from ~2004 and another from ~2024.
> 3.  Perform a supervised or unsupervised classification on both images to create two ==Land Use/Land Cover (LULC)== maps with at least three classes: `Urban`, `Vegetation`, `Bare Soil/Desert`.
> 4.  Use ==post-classification comparison== to identify and quantify the area that transitioned to the `Urban` class.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Pay close attention to atmospheric correction and normalizing the images before classification to ensure a fair comparison between the two dates.

> ### Exercise 4: Distinguishing Abrupt from Gradual Change
> Using an advanced time-series algorithm, you will analyze forest change in the Amazon basin.
> 1.  Define a study area in a region of the Amazon known for both deforestation and forest degradation.
> 2.  Using the full Landsat time-series (1984-present), apply an algorithm like ==LandTrendr== or ==BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend)==.
> 3.  Your goal is to identify and map two types of change:
>     -   ==Abrupt change==: e.g., clear-cutting for cattle ranching.
>     -   ==Gradual change==: e.g., slow degradation from selective logging.
> 4.  Compare the spatial patterns of these two change types in your study area.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Google Earth Engine has well-documented APIs for both LandTrendr and BFAST, which are computationally intensive and benefit from cloud processing.

> ### Exercise 5: Monitoring Surface Water Dynamics
> Your objective is to track the changes in a major reservoir's surface area over time.
> 1.  Select a large water body that has experienced significant changes (e.g., Lake Mead, USA, or the Aral Sea).
> 2.  Build a time-series of the ==Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI)== using Landsat imagery from 2000 to the present.
> 3.  For each year, delineate the water body extent by applying a threshold to the MNDWI values.
> 4.  Create a graph plotting the total water surface area (in km²) against time.
> 5.  What trends do you observe? Correlate your findings with known information about drought or water management policies in the region.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > MNDWI is calculated using the Green and SWIR bands. It is often more effective than NDWI at suppressing noise from built-up land.

> ### Exercise 6: Reconstructing a Signal from Noisy Data
> Real-world satellite data is often contaminated by clouds. Your task is to address this issue.
> 1.  Find a location and time period with a dense time-series (e.g., Sentinel-2) but significant cloud cover.
> 2.  Generate an NDVI time-series plot. You will notice erratic, low-value outliers caused by clouds.
> 3.  Apply a ==smoothing and gap-filling technique== to the time-series. Examples include:
>     -   Linear or spline interpolation.
>     -   A ==Savitzky-Golay filter==.
> 4.  Present the "raw" and the "reconstructed" time-series plots side-by-side and explain the improvements.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Before applying a filter, you'll need a robust cloud mask to identify which data points to replace or give lower weight to.

> ### Exercise 7: Mapping a Flood Event with SAR
> You will use radar data to map the extent of a flood, demonstrating its all-weather capabilities.
> 1.  Identify a recent major flood event.
> 2.  Download pre-flood and during-flood ==Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)== images for the area.
> 3.  Pre-process the images (e.g., thermal noise removal, radiometric calibration, terrain correction).
> 4.  Create a simple change detection image by subtracting the pre-flood backscatter values from the during-flood backscatter values.
> 5.  Interpret the result: Why do flooded areas typically appear darker (lower backscatter) in SAR imagery? Delineate the flood extent.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Calm water acts as a specular reflector, scattering the radar signal away from the sensor, resulting in very low backscatter values. This makes it stand out from the surrounding land.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 8: Pinpointing a Breakpoint in Time
> Your goal is to automatically detect the specific year a major land-use change event occurred.
> 1.  Select a site where a large, singular change event happened at a known time (e.g., the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in China, which began filling in 2003).
> 2.  Create a yearly time-series of a relevant index (e.g., MNDWI) for the area from 1990-2020.
> 3.  Apply a ==breakpoint detection== algorithm (like the `bfastmonitor` function in R or a similar statistical method) to the time-series.
> 4.  Does the detected breakpoint year match the known year of the event? Discuss any discrepancies.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > These algorithms work by fitting a stable historical model and then detecting the point in time where new observations systematically deviate from that model's forecast.

> ### Exercise 9: Time-Series of Thermal Anomalies
> Track the frequency and intensity of thermal hotspots to monitor fire activity or volcanic unrest.
> 1.  Choose a region with recurrent fire activity (e.g., California) or an active volcano (e.g., Mount Etna, Italy).
> 2.  Use a thermal dataset like ==MODIS/VIIRS Active Fire== products for a period of at least five years.
> 3.  Create a time-series plot showing the ==number of fire detections== per month.
> 4.  Generate a ==hotspot density map== (heatmap) to visualize the spatial distribution of the thermal anomalies over the entire period.
> 5.  Analyze the temporal plot for seasonality and the density map for spatial patterns. What do they reveal about the fire regime or volcanic activity?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The MODIS and VIIRS active fire products provide the geographic location of fires in near-real time, making them ideal for this type of temporal analysis.

> ### Exercise 10: Interpretation Challenge
> Below is an NDVI time-series plot from 2000 to 2020 for an unknown location. Your task is to write a detailed interpretation of the land cover dynamics.
> 
> *Imagine a pre-generated plot is embedded here showing a stable, low NDVI (~0.2) until 2008, followed by an abrupt spike and subsequent annual seasonal peaks (~0.7) and troughs (~0.3).*
> 
> Based on the plot, answer the following:
> 1.  Describe the state of the land cover before the major change event around ==2008==.
> 2.  Characterize the change event itself. Was it ==abrupt or gradual==?
> 3.  Describe the land use/cover ==after== the change. What do the annual peaks and troughs suggest?
> 4.  Propose a plausible real-world scenario that would create this specific time-series signature.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Think about what processes cause a sudden, sustained increase in vegetation productivity. Consider human activities like land reclamation for agriculture or irrigation projects.
