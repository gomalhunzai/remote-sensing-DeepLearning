# Exercises (remote sensing undergradute) – Quantitative Remote Sensing Principles
> Here are 10 practical exercises to apply the concepts from the chapter "Quantitative Remote Sensing Principles" and prepare for the assessment. They are specifically designed for remote sensing undergradute.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 1: DN to TOA Reflectance Conversion
> A Landsat 9 image of a forested area was acquired on July 15th, 2023. You need to convert the raw pixel values into a physically meaningful quantity.
>
> For a single pixel in the Near-Infrared (NIR) band, you have the following information:
> -   `==Digital Number (DN)==`: 45870
> -   Reflectance Mult Band (scaling factor): `0.0000275`
> -   Reflectance Add Band (offset): `-0.2`
> -   Sun Elevation Angle: `60.5` degrees
>
> **Task:** Calculate the `==Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance==` for this pixel. Show your steps.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The standard formula for DN to TOA Reflectance is a simple scaling. However, `==TOA Reflectance==` is often corrected for the solar elevation angle to normalize for different illumination conditions. The final reflectance should be unitless.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 2: The Impact of the Atmosphere
> Below are two spectral reflectance curves for the same dense vegetation target. Curve A represents `==Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance==` (as seen by the satellite), and Curve B represents `==Surface Reflectance==` (the true reflectance after atmospheric correction).
>
> 

>
> **Task:** Identify and explain three distinct differences between the two curves, linking each one to a specific atmospheric process (e.g., scattering, absorption).
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Think about what components of the atmosphere affect different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Consider `==Rayleigh scattering==` in the shorter wavelengths and `==water vapor absorption==` in the infrared.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 3: Deriving NDVI for Crop Health Assessment
> You are analyzing surface reflectance data from a Sentinel-2 image over a farm to assess crop health. You have extracted the reflectance values for two pixels: one from a healthy, well-irrigated cornfield and one from a stressed, dry-looking patch.
>
> -   **Pixel 1 (Healthy):** Red Reflectance = 0.04, `==Near-Infrared (NIR)==` Reflectance = 0.45
> -   **Pixel 2 (Stressed):** `==Red==` Reflectance = 0.15, NIR Reflectance = 0.25
>
> **Task:**
> 1.  Calculate the `==Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)==` for both pixels.
> 2.  Explain the difference in the results in terms of `==chlorophyll content==` and canopy cell structure.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The NDVI formula is (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red). Healthy vegetation is known for its strong absorption in the red and high reflectance in the NIR.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 4: Urban Heat Island Analysis
> You are studying the urban heat island effect using the thermal band of a satellite. After atmospheric correction, you have the `==brightness temperature==` for two surfaces. To get the true temperature, you must account for emissivity.
>
> -   **Surface A (Asphalt Road):** Brightness Temperature = 315 K, `==Emissivity (ε)==` = 0.95
> -   **Surface B (City Park):** Brightness Temperature = 305 K, Emissivity (ε) = 0.98
>
> **Task:** Calculate the `==Land Surface Temperature (LST)==` in Kelvin for both surfaces. Which surface is hotter, and by how much?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > A simplified formula to derive LST from brightness temperature (T_b) and emissivity (ε) is derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law: `LST = T_b / (ε^(1/4))`. This correction is crucial for accurate temperature mapping.

> ### Exercise 5: Understanding the Anisotropy of Surfaces
> You are examining a wide-swath satellite image (e.g., from MODIS or a drone mosaic) taken at midday. You notice that an area of uniform grassland appears significantly brighter on the side of the image that is directly opposite the sun's position. This phenomenon is known as the `==hotspot==`.
>
> **Task:** Explain this effect using the concept of the `==Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)==`. Why does the surface appear brighter from this specific viewing geometry?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Consider the relative positions of the sun, the surface, and the sensor. In the hotspot configuration, the sensor is viewing the scene from the same direction as the illumination source. What does this mean for the visibility of shadows cast by surface elements like grass blades?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 6: Retrieving Seabed Reflectance in Coastal Waters
> The signal a satellite receives over clear, shallow coastal water is a complex mixture of signals from the atmosphere, the water surface, the water column, and the seabed. To map seagrass beds, you must isolate the `==bottom reflectance==`.
>
> **Task:** Imagine you have already corrected for atmospheric effects, leaving you with the water-leaving radiance. Outline the conceptual steps required for `==water column correction==` to estimate the reflectance of the seabed. What key `==inherent optical properties==` (IOPs) of the water would you need to know or estimate?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Think of this as removing layers of an onion. The light is attenuated twice by the water column (downwelling and upwelling). You need to account for both absorption and scattering within the water.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 7: Inverting a Canopy RTM for LAI
> You are tasked with creating a `==Leaf Area Index (LAI)==` map for a soybean plantation. Instead of using a simple vegetation index, you decide to use a more physically-based approach. You have a measured `==surface reflectance==` spectrum for a specific field and access to the PROSAIL `==Radiative Transfer Model (RTM)==`.
>
> **Task:** Describe the process of `==model inversion==` you would use to find the LAI value that best explains your measured reflectance spectrum. What is a `==look-up table (LUT)==` and how is it used in this context?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The process involves running the model in "forward mode" many times with a range of input parameters (like LAI, chlorophyll content, etc.) to build a large database of simulated spectra. The inversion step is then about finding the best match in this database.

> ### Exercise 8: Validating a Retrieved LST Product
> You have successfully generated a Land Surface Temperature (LST) map from Sentinel-3 data for an agricultural region. Now, you must assess its accuracy. You have access to `==in-situ data==` from 15 temperature sensors on the ground, recorded at the exact time of the satellite overpass.
>
> **Task:** Describe a robust methodology to `==validate==` your LST product.
> 1.  How would you pair the satellite pixel values with the point-based ground measurements? Mention the issue of `==spatial mismatch==`.
> 2.  What two statistical metrics would you calculate to quantify the accuracy, and what does each one tell you?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > For metrics, consider one that measures the average magnitude of the error (e.g., `==Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)==`) and another that measures the systematic over- or under-estimation (e.g., `==bias==`).

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 9: Estimating Impervious Surface Area
> A single 30m Landsat pixel over a suburban neighborhood is a `==mixed pixel==`. You hypothesize it contains a mixture of three components: vegetation, impervious surface (e.g., rooftops, roads), and soil. Using a high-resolution image, you have identified pure reference spectra (`==endmembers==`) for each component.
>
> **Task:**
> 1.  Explain the principle of `==linear spectral unmixing==`.
> 2.  Describe how you would use the pixel's spectrum and the three endmember spectra to estimate the `==fractional abundance==` (or percentage cover) of impervious surface within that single pixel.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The core assumption is that the spectrum of the mixed pixel is a linear combination of the endmember spectra, weighted by their respective area fractions within the pixel. This can be solved as a system of equations.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 10: The Surface Energy Balance Equation
> The `==Surface Energy Balance==` (Rn = H + LE + G) is a foundational concept linking remote sensing to climatology and hydrology. For a specific location, you have used satellite data to estimate:
> -   Net Radiation (`==Rn==`): 450 W/m²
> -   Ground Heat Flux (G): 45 W/m²
>
> The remaining 405 W/m² must be partitioned between Sensible Heat Flux (H) and Latent Heat Flux (LE).
>
> **Task:** Explain how you could use remotely sensed `==Land Surface Temperature (LST)==` in combination with meteorological data (air temperature, wind speed) to estimate `==Sensible Heat Flux (H)==`. Once H is known, how do you determine the `==Latent Heat Flux (LE)==`, and what important biophysical process does LE represent?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > The formula for H is heavily dependent on the temperature difference between the surface (your LST product) and the overlying air. LE, the energy consumed by `==evapotranspiration==`, is often calculated as the residual term in the energy balance equation.
