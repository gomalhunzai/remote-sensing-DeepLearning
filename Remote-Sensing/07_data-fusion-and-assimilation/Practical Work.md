# Exercises (remote sensing undergradute) â€“ Data Fusion and Assimilation
> Here are 10 practical exercises to apply the concepts from the chapter "Data Fusion and Assimilation" and prepare for the assessment. They are specifically designed for remote sensing undergradute.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 1: The Pan-Sharpening Dilemma
> You are tasked with monitoring urban expansion for a city using Landsat 9 data. You have a 15m panchromatic band and 30m multispectral bands. To better distinguish small features like new buildings and roads, you decide to perform ==pan-sharpening==.
> 
> 1.  Choose two common pan-sharpening algorithms (e.g., IHS, Brovey, PCA).
> 2.  Describe the fundamental principle behind each chosen algorithm.
> 3.  Explain the potential trade-off between improving ==spatial resolution== and maintaining ==spectral integrity==. Which of your chosen methods is more likely to cause spectral distortion and why?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 2: Mapping a Flood with Incompatible Sensors
> A major river has flooded, and the entire area is covered by clouds. Your goal is to create an accurate map of the maximum flood extent. You have access to the following data:
> - A cloud-free **Sentinel-2** (optical) image from one week before the flood.
> - A **Sentinel-1** (SAR) image acquired during the peak of the flood.
> 
> Explain your workflow for combining this ==complementary information==. How would you leverage the strengths of both ==SAR== (cloud penetration, water sensitivity) and ==optical== (land cover context) data to produce a final flood map? What level of fusion (pixel, feature, or decision) would be most appropriate?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Think about what each sensor can classify on its own. How can you combine the classified results, rather than the raw pixel values?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 3: Reconstructing a Dense Vegetation Time-Series
> An agronomist wants to monitor the detailed ==phenology== of a cornfield to optimize fertilization. They need a time-series of NDVI at a 10m spatial resolution every 5 days. However, the available data is:
> - **Landsat 8/9:** 30m resolution, 8-16 day revisit time, often with cloud cover.
> - **MODIS:** 250m resolution, 1-2 day revisit time.
> 
> Propose a ==spatiotemporal fusion== strategy (like STARFM) to generate the desired high-resolution, high-frequency dataset. Draw a simple diagram to illustrate how information from the high-spatial and high-temporal images is blended to predict a high-resolution image on a specific date.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 4: Enhancing a Land Cover Map
> You have generated two independent land cover classification maps for a complex landscape:
> 1.  **Map A (from Sentinel-2):** Excellent at distinguishing crop types but poor at identifying waterlogged soil.
> 2.  **Map B (from Sentinel-1):** Excellent at identifying waterlogged soil but confuses certain crop types.
> 
> Describe a ==decision-level fusion== approach to combine these two maps into a single, more accurate land cover product. Mention at least two possible techniques (e.g., majority voting, using classifier confidence scores) and explain the logic behind your chosen approach.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Consider creating rules based on the known strengths of each classification. For example, "If Map B says 'waterlogged', trust it. Otherwise, trust Map A." This is a basic form of decision-level fusion.

> ### Exercise 5: Assimilating Soil Moisture into a Hydrological Model
> You are working with a hydrological model that simulates river discharge, but its predictions are often inaccurate because of poor soil moisture estimates. You have access to satellite-derived soil moisture data from the **SMAP** (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission.
> 
> Conceptually, explain how you would use ==data assimilation== to improve the model's performance. Define the following terms in your explanation:
> - The model's ==state variables== (what you are trying to correct).
> - The ==observation== (the SMAP data).
> - The purpose of an ==observation operator==.
> 
> What is the primary goal of this assimilation process: to correct past simulations or to improve future forecasts?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 6: Fusing LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data for Forestry
> A forestry company wants to create an inventory of a mixed-species forest, identifying not just the location but also the species of each individual tree. They have acquired co-registered airborne ==LiDAR== and ==hyperspectral== data.
>
> Outline a ==feature-level fusion== workflow to achieve this goal. What unique information (features) can be extracted from each data source, and how would their combination lead to a better classification than using either dataset alone?
> 
> - **From LiDAR:** (e.g., height, crown shape...)
> - **From Hyperspectral:** (e.g., leaf chemistry, specific reflectance troughs...)

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 7: Evaluating the Quality of a Fused Image
> You have used a pan-sharpening algorithm to fuse a 30m Landsat multispectral image with its corresponding 15m panchromatic band. Now, you must prove to a client that the resulting fused image is of high quality.
> 
> According to Wald's protocol, a high-quality fused product should be as identical as possible to what a high-resolution sensor would have observed. Explain how you would quantitatively assess the quality of your fused image. Describe at least two metrics: one for ==spectral fidelity== and one for ==spatial fidelity==.
> 
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > For spectral quality, consider metrics like the ==SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper)== or ==ERGAS==. For spatial quality, think about comparing high-pass filtered versions of the images.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 8: Improving Change Detection with a Virtual Constellation
> You need to monitor rapid deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, where illegal logging can clear an area in just a few days. Using only Landsat (16-day revisit) is insufficient due to the event's speed and frequent cloud cover.
> 
> Explain how you can create a ==virtual constellation== by combining data from **Landsat-8** and **Sentinel-2**. What are the main challenges in this ==data harmonization== process before you can perform a fused time-series analysis for change detection?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 9: Characterizing Agricultural Plots with Feature Fusion
> Your task is to distinguish between fields of corn and soybeans, which can have similar spectral signatures at certain growth stages. You have access to both Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Optical) imagery for the same date.
> 
> Propose a ==feature-level fusion== approach.
> 1.  List at least two distinct features you could derive from the **Sentinel-1** data (think about structure and roughness).
> 2.  List at least two distinct features you could derive from the **Sentinel-2** data (think about spectral indices).
> 3.  How would you combine these features into a single ==feature stack== for input into a machine learning classifier (e.g., Random Forest)?

> ### Exercise 10: The Role of Assimilation in Weather Forecasting
> Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are the backbone of modern weather forecasts. Their accuracy heavily relies on the quality of their initial conditions.
> 
> Choose **one** of the following satellite-derived products:
> - Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
> - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)
> - Sea Ice Concentration
> 
> For your chosen product, explain why its ==assimilation== into an ==NWP model== is critical. How does incorporating this specific real-world observation help correct the model's state and lead to more reliable forecasts?
