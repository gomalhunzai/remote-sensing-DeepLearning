# Exercises (remote sensing undergradute) – UAV and Small Satellite Platforms
> Here are 10 practical exercises to apply the concepts from the chapter "UAV and Small Satellite Platforms" and prepare for the assessment. They are specifically designed for remote sensing undergradute.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 1: Platform Selection for Agricultural Monitoring
> You are a remote sensing consultant hired by two different clients:
> 1.  A farmer who owns a 50-hectare vineyard and wants weekly updates on vine health (e.g., water stress).
> 2.  A government agency tasked with monitoring seasonal drought conditions across the entire Murray-Darling Basin in Australia (approx. 1 million km²).
>
> For each client, recommend whether a ==UAV platform== or a ==Small Satellite constellation== (like Planet's Doves) is more appropriate. Justify your choice by comparing the platforms based on ==spatial resolution==, ==temporal resolution (revisit rate)==, ==cost-effectiveness==, and ==operational scalability==.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 2: UAV Flight Plan Design for Coastal Erosion
> You need to map a 2 km stretch of coastline to monitor erosion. Your goal is to produce a high-resolution orthomosaic and Digital Surface Model (DSM). You are using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro quadcopter.
>
> Outline the key parameters you would set in a flight planning software (e.g., DroneDeploy, Pix4Dcapture). Specifically, define and provide realistic values for:
> - Flight Altitude (AGL)
> - ==Ground Sampling Distance (GSD)==
> - ==Forward Overlap (Endlap)==
> - ==Side Overlap (Sidelap)==
> - Camera angle (nadir vs. oblique)
>
> Explain *why* your chosen overlap values are crucial for generating an accurate ==3D point cloud== using Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques.
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > Consider the trade-off between flight time/number of photos and the desired GSD. A high overlap (e.g., >75%) is standard for SfM to ensure robust feature matching between images.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 3: Small Satellite Constellation Concept
> Imagine you are designing a new small satellite mission for the specific purpose of monitoring methane =="super-emitter"== sites (like oil and gas facilities) globally.
>
> Propose a conceptual design for your constellation. Your proposal must describe:
> - **Platform:** What ==CubeSat== form factor would you choose (e.g., 3U, 6U, 12U) and why?
> - **Orbit:** What orbital type (e.g., ==Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO)==, Equatorial LEO) is most suitable and why?
> - **Sensor:** What kind of primary sensor would be required? (You don't need a specific model, but describe the sensor type, e.g., a ==hyperspectral sensor== sensitive to the short-wave infrared part of the spectrum).
> - **Revisit Time:** What is your target revisit time for a given site?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 4: Data Processing Workflow for Precision Agriculture
> You have just completed a UAV survey of a cornfield using a multispectral camera (e.g., MicaSense RedEdge), capturing 850 individual images.
>
> List the major steps in the ==photogrammetric processing workflow== to get from the raw images to a final, usable ==NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)== map. Your workflow should include, but not be limited to, the following stages:
> 1.  Initial Quality Check
> 2.  Image Alignment / Tie Point Generation
> 3.  Georeferencing (using GCPs)
> 4.  Dense Point Cloud Generation
> 5.  Orthomosaic and DSM creation
> 6.  Radiometric Calibration
> 7.  Vegetation Index Calculation
>
> For steps 3 and 6, briefly explain their importance for producing an analytically valid NDVI map.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 5: Sensor Payload Comparison
> A client wants to map an invasive aquatic weed in a complex network of lakes. They are considering two data sources:
> - **Option A:** Data from a ==PlanetScope-Dove== small satellite (3-5 m GSD, 4 spectral bands: Blue, Green, Red, NIR).
> - **Option B:** Commissioning a survey with a UAV carrying a ==Headwall Nano-Hyperspec== sensor (tunable GSD <10 cm, 270 spectral bands from 400-1000 nm).
>
> Compare these two sensor payloads. Which one would be better for accurately identifying the specific species of invasive weed and discriminating it from native vegetation? Justify your answer based on ==spectral resolution== and ==spatial resolution==.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 6: Regulatory and Privacy Challenges
> A real estate company wants to use a UAV to capture high-resolution aerial imagery and create 3D models of a dense urban neighborhood for a development proposal.
>
> Identify and explain at least two ==major regulatory challenges== and two ==major ethical/privacy challenges== associated with this mission. How could the company mitigate these challenges?
>
> > [!TIP] Hint
> > For regulations, think about airspace classes, flight over people, and local ordinances. For ethics, consider what the camera can see besides rooftops.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 7: Data Latency in Disaster Response
> A wildfire has broken out in a remote, mountainous region. Emergency managers need to know the active fire perimeter as quickly as possible. A small satellite with a thermal infrared sensor has just passed over the area.
>
> Describe the typical journey of the data from the satellite to the end-user. Explain the factors that contribute to ==data latency== in this scenario. What is the role of the ==ground station network== and ==data processing centers== in minimizing this delay?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 8: Cost-Benefit Analysis for Monitoring Deforestation
> The government of Colombia wants to set up a new program to monitor illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in near-real-time. They are evaluating three options:
> 1.  **UAV Fleet:** Purchase and operate a fleet of long-endurance, fixed-wing UAVs.
> 2.  **Dedicated SmallSat:** Fund the development and launch of their own dedicated Earth Observation small satellite.
> 3.  **Data Subscription:** Purchase a subscription for high-cadence data from a commercial provider like ==Planet== or ==BlackSky==.
>
> Perform a qualitative ==cost-benefit analysis==. Discuss the pros and cons of each option, considering factors like ==initial investment==, ==operational complexity==, ==coverage area==, and ==data timeliness==. Which would you recommend?

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 9: SfM Photogrammetry vs. LiDAR for Forestry
> A forestry company needs to create a detailed inventory of a 200-hectare commercial pine plantation. They need to accurately measure individual tree heights and estimate the Canopy Fuel Load.
>
> Compare and contrast the use of a UAV-mounted RGB camera (processed using ==Structure from Motion - SfM==) with a UAV-mounted ==LiDAR== sensor for this task.
>
> Your comparison should focus on:
> - The ability of each technology to create a ==Digital Terrain Model (DTM)== vs. a ==Digital Surface Model (DSM)==.
> - The accuracy of the resulting Canopy Height Model (CHM).
> - The relative cost and data processing complexity.

> [!question]
> ### Exercise 10: The Future of SmallSat Capabilities
> New technological trends are set to revolutionize small satellite capabilities. Discuss the potential impact of the following two technologies on the future of Earth Observation from small satellite platforms:
>
> 1.  ==On-board AI / Edge Computing==: How could processing data directly on the satellite change how we monitor dynamic events like floods or oil spills?
> 2.  ==Inter-satellite Links (ISLs)==: How could "talking" satellites in a constellation improve data delivery speed and global coverage?
>
> Provide one concrete application example for each technology.
